Enable MFA for Root User : 

Multi Factor Authentication : 

--> Virtual MFA : Google Authenticator, Authy 2 factor, Microsoft authenticator.. 
--> hardware MFA : 
--> u2f / Yuby 2 Key : 

_____

IAM User : 

root credentials ...????

Requirement : 
Storage User : S3 : Need an IAM User with S3 permissions :..!! 


Step 1 : 
Username : s3admin : 
Access Type : Management console / Prog access
AWS Management console Access : GUI : Browser : Username, Password and Sign-In
Programatic Access : CLI : cli, sdk, cdk : AccessKeyID and SecretAccessKey

Pwd : auto generated and enforce user to create new pwd.

Step 2 : Allocate Permissions : 
Policy : Set of permissions on AWS : AWSS3FullAccess : 


ec2admins : EC2FullAccess : 

_______________________________

Least privilages mechanism : 

==> All these users present in same aws account. 

s3_admin: Storage service : Instead of root access : s3 full access
ec2_admin : ec2 : compute service : Instead of root access : ec2 full access
TL : All aws services : root access :  Instead of root access : IAM User with admin access 

IAM : Identity and access management : We can create users, manage user accesses on aws services based on the user job role. 

Policy : Docuemnt that contains set of permissions on aws environment. 



Task : create an AWS account and make it fully activated.

Task 1 : Activate MFA for root user. Set alia for your root account.

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Allocate "S3FullAccess" to this user, Login as S3_user and verify his access on s3 service, Iam service & ec2 service. (He should be able to access only s3)

Task 2 : Create an IAM user(Username : ec2_user), Allocate "EC2FullAccess" to this user, Login as ec2_user and verify his access on s3 service, Iam service & ec2 service. (He should be able to access only ec2)

______________

Policy : Set of Permissions on our aws account. Policy writtens in JSON format.
--> AWS Managed - Job Function
--> AWS Managed Policy
--> Customer Managed Policy


Password policy : 

__________________

Policy : Document contains set of permissions writtens in JSON format. Policy provide permissions on AWS resources for users/groups/roles.

--> AWS Managed Policy : s3 (full, reaonly), ec2 (ec2read, moniroting, full)
--> AWS Managed policy - Job Functions : Network Admin, Database Admin
--> Customer Managed Policy : 

Inline : Not a reusable policy. We can apply policy for specific resource.

Requirement : IAM User required Full Access on AWS services, But not on "S3".

**Deny always have highest privilages. If you all 100 times, but deny 1 times at any level, DENY will take effect. 

S3 and EC2 Full Access As a single policy : 

Task : Create a Policy to Activate MFA, if we associate this policy to an IAM user. 
--> Create an IAM user, provide him "S3FullAccess"... Click on "security credentials", Go to Activate MFA option.. "Deny"... create a policy to allow only this particular operation.
-> After associting this policy to S3user, it should allow him to enable/disable MFA.


Task 1 : Create an IAM user and Provide "Administrator ACcess" and use same user throughout course.

Task 2 : provide Billing level access for the IAM user you created in "TASK 1"

Task 3 : I need an IAM user who have "Administrator Access", But no permissions on s3.
